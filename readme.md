# This is a digital clock with animation, made with pure HTMl, CSS, JS.
###### The animation is entirely controlled by JS
### NOTE: I've used object collections in my JS to prevent the DOM from updating every interval and instead update only the outdated ones.
### NOTE2: The default HTML has pre-set values for the clock in case the user doesn't have Javascript enabled, just to avoid breaking the good look of the clock
